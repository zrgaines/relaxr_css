# Relaxr Landing Page: Part 2

Now that you spent last night laying out the content for Relaxr's Landing Page, tonight you will style your HTML to look like the design comp. The designer provided a `design_file.txt` that has font styles and colors for you to use in your CSS. If you'd like to continue working off your own `index.html` from last night, feel free to do so. Otherwise there is a finished `index.html` with the addition of classes and ids to help with your styling in the `starter_code`. 

In `starter_code/css` there is an empty `style.css` file for you to add your custom styles. Ther is also a `css/reset.css` that has already been linked in the provided `index.html`. Remember, reset files and normalize files help with styling across browsers to get rid of any inconsistencies so your custom stylesheet should be linked after it.

Hints:
- Be sure to include the google fonts link from the design_file.txt in your HTML `<head>` as well as a link to your custom styles sheet
- Your custom stylesheet needs to be linked after the reset file for your styles to show up
- Feel free to change any classes and ids! These are just a suggestion!
